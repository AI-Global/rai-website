# Layout

The `Layout` component represents the main layout of the website. You can think of it as the "shell" that holds the rest of the content for the website.

The `Layout` component should almost always be used as the most parent component of any page that is created.

## Usage

```tsx
import { Layout } from "@/components/Container";
```

## Props

<ArgsTable component={Layout} />

## Example

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Default">
    {(args) => (
      <Layout {...args}>
        A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human
        being to come to harm;
      </Layout>
    )}
  </Story>
</Canvas>
