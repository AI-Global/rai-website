# Button

`Buttons` are a user interface component that allow users to navigation pages, as well as initiate, complete, and reverse actions.

## Usage

```tsx
import { Button } from "@/components/Button";
```

## Props

<ArgsTable component={Button} />

## Accessibility Notes

- `Button` variations should be chosen to have high contrast with the background.

## Example

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Default"
    args={{ title: "Roger, roger", url: "https://responsible.ai/" }}
  >
    {(args) => <Button {...args} />}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Variations

Different variations of buttons should be used for different situations.

### Primary

Primary buttons should be used for highly important call to actions.

<Canvas>
  <Button title="Roger, roger" url="/responsible-ai" variation="primary" />
</Canvas>

### Inverted

Inverted buttons should be used for highly important call to actions that are displayed on a dark background.

<Canvas>
  <Button title="Roger, roger" url="/responsible-ai" variation="inverted" />
</Canvas>
