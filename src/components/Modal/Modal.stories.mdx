# Modal

A `Modal` is an overlay that allows users to view additional information. It also prevent users from interacting with the rest of the page until it has been closed.

## Usage

```tsx
import { Modal } from "@/components/Modal";
```

## Props

<ArgsTable component={Modal} />

## Accessibility Notes

- The content inside of a `Modal` is **not** SEO friendly. Do not rely on a `Modal` to show critical or important information.

## Example

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Default">
    {(args) => {
      const [open, setOpen] = useState(true);
      return (
        <>
          <button onClick={toggleModal}>Toggle Modal</button>
          <Modal open={open} onClose={toggleModal}>
            This is a modal.
          </Modal>
        </>
      );
      function toggleModal() {
        setOpen(!open);
      }
    }}
  </Story>
</Canvas>
