# Block: Members

`Members` is used to display a group of members logos in a grid. It will allow for groups of `Members Group` content types in `Contentful`

## Usage

```tsx
import { Members } from "@/blocks/Members";
```

## Fragment

The `Members` component exposes a `GraphQL` fragment `MembersBlockFragment`.

```graphql
query MyContentfulQuery {
  query
  MyQuery {
    ...MembersBlockFragment
  }
}
```

## Content usages

<ContentType query={useAllContentfulMembers} component={Members} />
