import { Meta, Canvas, Story, ArgsTable } from "@storybook/addon-docs/blocks";
import { PageTitle } from ".";

<Meta title="layout/PageTitle" component={PageTitle} />

# PageTitle

A `PageTitle` is reserved for showing the title of a page as the first thing on a page.

This should be considered when you are not using a `@/blocks` component as the first element on your page.

## Usage

```tsx
import { PageTitle } from "@/components/PageTitle";
```

## Props

<ArgsTable component={PageTitle} />

## Accessibility Notes

- Because the `PageTitle` uses an `h1`, it should only ever be used once on a page.

## Example

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Default" args={{ title: "The robots are taking over" }}>
    {(args) => <PageTitle {...args} />}
  </Story>
</Canvas>
