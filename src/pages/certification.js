                The worldâ€™s first independent, accredited certification program
                of its kind.
              </strong>
              <br />
              Developed under the Global AI Action Alliance for the World
              Economic
              <br /> Forum (WEF), along with a diverse community of leading
              experts, RAI
              <br /> certification is based on objective assessments of
              fairness, bias,
              <br /> explainability, and other concrete metrics of responsibly
              built AI
              <br /> systems. The Schwartz Reisman Institute for Technology and
              Society
              <br /> (SRI) at University of Toronto is serving as a business
              partner on the
              <br /> development phase of the initiative.

            <strong>Certify AI Systems, not individuals</strong>
            <br />
            Focus on the technology components and governance of systems.
            <br /> This is not a certification program for developers or data
            scientists.
            <br />
            <br /> <strong>Build on existing frameworks and regulations</strong>
            <br />
            Provide a practical and unified framework that translates across
            <br /> already-existing work from the industry. We are not trying to
            <br /> re-inventing the wheel.
            <br />
            <br /> <strong>Assessments specific to system type</strong><br/>Assessment criteria
            will be customized based on the type of AI system
            <br /> being assessed (e.g., Intelligent process automation, Image &
            Object
            <br /> recognition, Text & Speech Analysis, Advanced data analytics,
            NLP &<br /> content creation)
            <br />
            <br /> <strong>Assessments specific to domain and region</strong>
            <br />
            In order to have meaningful substance, assessment criteria will also
            <br /> cover specific application domains (e.g., credit &
            collections,
            <br /> healthcare diagnostics, etc.), and regions.
